   +-----------------------------------------------------+

Genre supports multiple algorithms for patching, with different tradeoffs for
performance and quality. **These are expert parameters. Most users should not
need more than the** :ref:`standard parameters <rade/PATCHES_Namelist:PATCHES
Namelist>`.

- `PAVE <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/pave.html>`_

  - **Pros:** produces neat tilings that account for patch planarity and
    irregularity. The algorithm is fast (linear in the number of faces).

  - **Cons:** uniform coarsening of the mesh. Only supports faces-per-patch
    ratios of roughly 4 or 6, depending on whether the mesh is hexahedral or
    tetrahedral.

- `VSA <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html>`_
  :footcite:`Cohen-Steiner:2004:VSA`

  - **Pros:** works well for arbitrary faces-per-patch ratios. Provides flexible
    control of the geometric patch diameters. Maximizes patch planarity.
    Provides choice between patches with roughly the same number of faces, or
    roughly the same surface area.

  - **Cons:** can be extremely slow for large meshes (scales badly), due to a
    quadratic dependence on the number of faces. However, once computed, the
    result can be reused with the :ref:`FILE method
    <rade/PATCHES_Namelist_Expert_Options:patch_algorithm>` allowing
    experimentation with Chaparral parameters without rerunning the algorithm.

- `METIS <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/metis.html>`_
  :footcite:`Karypis:1998:METIS`

  - **Pros:** works well for arbitrary faces-per-patch ratios. The algorithm is
    fast by leveraging the METIS library. Provides choice between patches with
    roughly the same number of faces, or roughly the same surface area. In the
    second case, the constraint is tight, so the faces-per-patch ratio is
    largely ignored and need only be approximate.

  - **Cons:** New and not extensively tested. Patch planarity is not explicitly
    maximized, but at least patches will not straddle "sharp edges" (see `here
    <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/metis.html#dual-graph>`_
    for more details). Note that it is not clear whether patch planarity, or
    lack thereof, affects the quality of the thermal radiation model.

- `VAC <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vac.html>`_

  - Retained for developer use and not recommended for regular users. It has
    similar limitations to PAVE, but produces lower quality patches.

Refer to each algorithm's documentation for extensive details on its properties,
limitations, and supported inputs.

General Parameters
------------------

patch_algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Selects one of the available algorithms, or disables patching.

:Type: string
:Default: ``'METIS'``
:Valid Values:
   - ``'NONE'``: No patches will be generated. All other parameters are ignored.
     This is equivalent to an absent **PATCHES** namelist.
   - ``'PAVE'``: Generate patches with the `PAVE algorithm
     <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/pave.html>`_.
   - ``'VAC'``: Generate patches with the `VAC algorithm
     <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vac.html>`_.
   - ``'VSA'``: Generate patches with the `VSA algorithm
     <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html>`_.
   - ``'METIS'``: Generate patches with the `METIS algorithm
     <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/metis.html>`_.
   - ``'FILE'``: Patches will be read from a file. Because the cost of computing
     patches can be quite substantial for very large enclosure meshes, this
     pseudo-algorithm is provided to enable the use of previously computed
     patches.


verbosity_level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the verbosity level for all console output of the patch algorithm.

:Type: integer
:Default: 1
:Valid Values: -  0: Suppress all output.
               -  1: Print a summary of the run when algorithm finishes.
               - >1: Print detailed run information, used for debugging.


max_angle
^^^^^^^^^
Defines the maximum allowable angle (in degrees) between adjacent faces.

:Type: real
:Default: 20.0
:Valid Values: [0, 180]

All the patch algorithms construct the `adjacency matrix
<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdjacencyMatrix.html>`_ of the enclosure faces to
efficiently determine which faces are adjacent to others. If the normals of two
'topologically adjacent' faces exceed *max_angle*, then the faces will not be
neighbors in the internal adjacency matrix.

.. figure:: images/connected_components.png
   :figwidth: 45%
   :align: center

   The connected components of the outer surface of a furnace funnel. MAX_ANGLE
   is set to 20 degrees. Each component is a different color. The face edges are
   omitted for clarity.

The patch algorithms guarantee that patches will be *connected sets* of faces.
Therefore, ``max_angle`` divides the enclosure into connected components of
faces wherever there are 'sharp' edges whose angle exceeds the parameter.
Patches will never span more than one component.

.. note::
  ``max_angle`` only applies to *pairs of adjacent faces*, so two faces within a
  patch may be at an angle greater than ``max_angle`` if the faces between them
  are at sufficiently large angles. This is unlikely in practice, given a
  reasonably smooth enclosure and small ``max_angle``.

.. seealso::
   The effects of ``max_angle`` vary by algorithm. Refer to the documentation of
   the `PAVE
   <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/pave.html>`_, `VAC
   <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vac.html>`_, and `VSA
   <https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html>`_
   algorithms for more details.


FILE Parameters
---------------
The following namelist parameter applies only to the FILE algorithm.

patch_file
^^^^^^^^^^
The path to an existing radiation enclosure file containing patch information.
The enclosure defined by the file must be identical to the current enclosure.
This may be an absolute path or a relative path.

:Type: case-sensitive string
:Valid Values: must be a valid path


PAVE Parameters
---------------

The following namelist parameters apply only to the PAVE algorithm. For more
information, refer to the `PAVE algorithm documentation
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/pave.html>`_.


pave_merge_level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Controls the aggressiveness of patch merging. After paving is complete, there
will be a valid patching of the enclosure. The algorithm then attempts to merge
patches in order to reduce the patch count.

:Type: integer
:Default: 3
:Valid Values: - 0: No merging.
               - 1: Merge patches that are within the faces of a vertex.
               - 2: Same as 1. Additionally, merge patches that are within the
                 faces of pairs of adjacent vertices. The old patches are
                 requeued with their original weight so that a merge is only
                 performed if the merge candidate has a lower weight than any of
                 its consituent patches.
               - :math:`\geq 3`: Same as 2. Additionally, merge patches within
                 the faces of pairs of adjacent vertices, but add a large weight
                 to the requeued old patches. This ensures that the merge is
                 always performed.


pave_split_patch_size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the maximum size of patches to be split during patch merging.

:Type: integer
:Default: 3
:Valid Values: :math:`\gt 1`

Before merging patches, all :ref:`merge methods
<rade/PATCHES_Namelist_Expert_Options:pave_merge_level>` find patches with less
than ``pave_split_patch_size`` faces and 'split' them into 1-face patches. The
original patches aren't actually modified, rather they are re-queued along with
their constituent faces. This allows the algorithm to find more merge candidates
and then 'fill in the gaps' with the 1-face patches.

The 1-face patches have a large weight, so they will only be used after all
other patches are set. Therefore, the enclosure will tend retain the same
patches as before the split, unless this is not possible due to a merge.

.. note::
   For best results, set ``pave_split_patch_size`` to 3 for quadrilateral meshes
   and to 5 for triangular meshes. This avoids splitting too many patches.


pave_random_seed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the seed for the random number generator used to pick the initial seed
patches.

:Type: integer
:Default: The seed is taken from the system clock.
:Valid Values: :math:`\gt 0`

The PAVE algorithm begins by creating a 'seed patch' in each connected component
of the enclosure. Each component is then 'paved' or 'tiled' with patches,
starting from the seed patch. The seed patches are chosen randomly from a set of
patches determined to produce optimal results. Refer to the `seed patches
section
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/pave.html#choosing-seed-patches>`_
of the PAVE documentation for more information on how the seed patches are
selected.

This parameter sets the seed for the random number generator used to pick the
seed patches. Therefore, runs with the same value for this parameter will
produce identical results. If this parameter is not specified, then the seed is
taken from the system clock and results will likely vary from run to run.


VAC Parameters
--------------

The following namelist parameters apply only to the VAC algorithm. For more
information, refer to the `VAC algorithm documentation
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vac.html>`_.


vac_merge_level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Controls the aggressiveness of patch merging. After the main stage of the VAC
algorithm, there will be a valid patching of the enclosure. The algorithm then
attempts to merge patches in order to reduce the patch count.

:Type: integer
:Default: 3
:Valid Values: - 0: No merging.
               - 1: Merge patches that are within the faces of a vertex.
               - 2: Same as 1. Additionally, merge patches that are within the
                 faces of pairs of adjacent vertices. The old patches are
                 requeued with their original weight so that a merge is only
                 performed if the merge candidate has a lower weight than any of
                 its consituent patches.
               - :math:`\geq 3`: Same as 2. Additionally, merge patches within
                 the faces of pairs of adjacent vertices, but add a large weight
                 to the requeued old patches. This ensures that the merge is
                 always performed.


vac_split_patch_size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the maximum size of patches to be split during patch merging.

:Type: integer
:Default: 3
:Valid Values: :math:`\gt 1`

Before merging patches, all :ref:`merge methods
<rade/PATCHES_Namelist_Expert_Options:vac_merge_level>` find patches with less
than ``vac_split_patch_size`` faces and 'split' them into 1-face patches. The
original patches aren't actually modified, rather they are re-queued along with
their constituent faces. This allows the algorithm to find more merge candidates
and then 'fill in the gaps' with the 1-face patches.

The 1-face patches have a large weight, so they will only be used after all
other patches are set. Therefore, the enclosure will tend retain the same
patches as before the split, unless this is not possible due to a merge.

.. note::
   For best results, set ``vac_split_patch_size`` to 3 for quadrilateral meshes
   and to 5 for triangular meshes. This avoids splitting too many patches.



VSA Parameters
--------------

The following namelist parameters apply only to the VSA algorithm. For more
information, refer to the `VSA algorithm documentation
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html>`_.


vsa_max_iter
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the maximum number of iterations.

:Type: integer
:Default: 1000
:Valid Values: :math:`\geq 1`

The algorithm stops when ``vsa_max_iter`` is reached, regardless of other
terminating conditions.


vsa_min_delta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the minimum allowable change in patch proxies between successive
iterations.

:Type: real
:Default: 1.0E-6
:Valid Values: :math:`\geq 0.0`

At the end of each iteration, the new patch proxies for the next iteration are
computed and compared against the old proxies. The algorithm keeps track of the
*minimum* change between the old and new proxies. This change is computed as the
sum of the squares of the difference between the old and new proxy vectors. If
the minimum change in patch proxies is less than ``vsa_min_delta``, the
algorithm stops at that iteration.


vsa_face_patch_ratio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the ratio of total faces to total patches, and by extension the total
number of patches.

:Type: real
:Default: 4.0
:Valid Values: :math:`\geq 1.0`

Since the number of faces is fixed, this parameter determines the total number
of patches in the final configuration:

.. math::
   \text{(Total Patches)} = \text{(Total Faces)}\ /\ \text{vsa_face_patch_ratio}

Rather than set the number of patches explicitly, which is mesh dependent,
expressing this parameter as a ratio allows the same value to apply to a variety
of meshes.


vsa_max_patch_radius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the desired maximum radius for a patch.

:Type: real
:Default: ``sqrt(huge(0.0_r8))``
:Valid Values: :math:`\gt 0.0`

This parameter is used to compute the *size bias* term of the weight of a face
relative to a patch proxy. Refer to the `size bias section
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html#size-bias>`_ of
the VSA documentation for more information on how the parameter affects the face
weight computation.

Note that the default value of this parameter is ``sqrt(huge(0.0_r8))``
because it is squared in the face weight computation. By taking the root of
``huge(0.0_r8)`` we prevent floating point overflow errors. Numerically,
the default value on the order of :math:`1.34\times 10^{154}`.


vsa_normalize_dist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Determines whether to normalize the distance bias.

:Type: logical
:Default: True

This parameter affects the computation of the *distance bias* term of the weight
of a face relative to a patch proxy. Broadly speaking, enabling normalization
tends to produce patches with a similar number of faces, regardless of the
physical size of each patch. Conversely, disabling normalization tends to make
all patches about the same physical size, regardless of the number of faces in
each patch.

Refer to the `distance bias section
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html#distance-bias>`_
of the VSA documentation for more information on how the parameter affects the
face weight computation.


vsa_random_seed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Defines the seed for the random number generator used to pick the initial seed
patches.

:Type: integer
:Default: The seed is taken from the system clock.
:Valid Values: :math:`\gt 0`

The VSA algorithm uses a 'farthest-point' initialization method to choose the
seed patches for the first iteration. To start, a random face in each connected
component of the enclosure is chosen as a seed patch. Then, seed patches are
added one at a time by performing a `partitioning
<https://www.truchas.org/docs/sphinx/tools/RadE/patches/vsa.html#geometry-partitioning>`_
and then choosing the face with highest total distortion as the new seed patch.

This parameter sets the seed for the random number generator used to pick the
first seed patch in each connected component. Therefore, runs with the same
value for this parameter will produce identical results. If this parameter is
not specified, then the seed is taken from the system clock and results will
likely vary from run to run.



METIS Parameters (Advanced)
---------------------------
The METIS graph partitioning routine admits the following integer-valued options
that may be specified, though all have reasonable defaults so that none must be
specified. See the METIS documentation :footcite:`Karypis:1998:METIS`
for more details on these options.

metis_ptype
^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the partitioning method.

:Type: integer
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: - 0: Multilevel recursive bisection
               - 1: Multilevel :math:`k`-way partitioning


metis_objtype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the type of objective.

:Type: integer
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: - 0: Edge-cut minimization.
               - 1: Total communication volume minimization.


metis_ctype
^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the matching scheme to be used during coarsening.

:Type: integer
:Default: 1
:Valid Values: - 0: Random matching
               - 1: Sorted heavy-edge matching


metis_iptype
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the algorithm used during initial partitioning (recursive bisection
only).

:Type: integer
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: - 0: Grows a bisection using a greedy strategy
               - 1: Computes a bisection at random followed by a refinement
               - 2: Derives a separator from an edge cut.
               - 3: Grow a bisection using a greedy node-based strategy


metis_niter
^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the number of iterations of the refinement algorithm at each stage of
the uncoarsening process.

:Type: integer
:Default: 10
:Valid Values: :math:`\geq 1`


metis_minconn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies whether the partitioning procedure should seek to minimize the maximum
degree of the subdomain graph. The subdomain graph is the graph in which each
partition is a node, and edges connect subdomains with a shared interface.

:Type: integer
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: - 0: Does not explicitly minimize the maximum connectivity.
               - 1: Explicitly minimize the maximum connectivity.


metis_no2hop
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies that the coarsening will not perform any 2–hop matchings when the
standard matching approach fails to sufficiently coarsen the graph.

:Type: integer
:Default: 1
:Valid Values: - 0: Performs a 2–hop matching.
               - 1: Does not perform a 2–hop matching.

.. note::
   The 2–hop matching is very effective for graphs with power-law degree
   distributions.


metis_contig
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies whether the partitioning procedure should produce partitions that are
contiguous. If the dual graph of the mesh is not connected this option is
ignored.

:Type: integer
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: - 0: Does not force contiguous partitions.
               - 1: Forces contiguous partitions.


metis_dbglvl
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the amount and type of diagnostic information that will be written to
**stderr** by the partitioning procedure.

:Type: integer
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: :math:`\geq 1`

The default `0` means no output. Use `1` to write some basic information. Refer
to the METIS documentation :footcite:`Karypis:1998:METIS` for the many
other possible values and the output they generate.
