THE GENRE INPUT FILE FORMAT
---------------------------

The following namelist is required:


&ENCLOSURE
  name =               ! user-supplied name for the enclosure
  mesh_file =          ! path to the Exodus/Genesis mesh file
  coord_scale_factor = ! scale coord data by this factor (opt)
  exodus_block_modulus = ! replace element block IDs by their value modulo this value
  ignore_block_IDs =   ! list of element blocks to mask-off from the mesh (optional
  side_set_ids =       ! list of side sets specifying the surface
  symmetries =         ! list of up to 3 symmetry operations:
                       ! Mirror<a>, a = X, Y, Z; e.g. MirrorZ
                       ! Rot<a><n>, a = X, Y, Z; n integer; e.g., RotZ3, RotX16
  displace_block_ids = ! list of element blocks that will be displaced (opt)
  displacement       = ! the (x,y,z) displacement vector  (opt)
/

The following namelist is optional:

  &CHAPARRAL
    blocking_enclosure  = .true.
    partial_enclosure   = .true.
    partial_area        = 50.0
    BSP_max_tree_depth  = 10
    BSP_min_leaf_length = 25
    spatial_tolerance   = 1.0e-8
    hemicube_resolution = 200
    min_separation      = 10.0
    max_subdivisions    = 20
    smoothing_tolerance = 1.0e-8
    smoothing_max_iter  = 100
    verbosity_level
    smoothing_weight
  /

o The order of the namelists does not matter, and there may be other stuff
  in the input file; behavior is similar to Truchas input files.

o There must be a single ENCLOSURE namelist, and at most one CHAPARRAL
  namelist.  The first instance found is the one used.  If there is a
  CHAPARRAL namelist the specified enclosure surface is generated and
  written to the enclosure file along with the calculated view factors,
  otherwise just the enclosure surface is written; this is useful for
  examining the surface for correctness prior to performing the expensive
  view factor calculation.

o Element blocks that are displaced must be totally disconnected from the
  remaining blocks.  The displacement is done after the surfaces are
  extracted from the mesh and AFTER the coordinate scale factor applied.

o Accuracy of the raw VF calculation is controlled by min_separation
  and hemicube_resolution.

o Accuracy of the final smoothing step is controlled by smoothing_tolerance.
  The smoothing step should not require a lot of work.

o "Back stop" parameters that prevent runaway calculations are:
  max_subdivisions, smoothing_max_iterations.  If any of these are
  tripped the VF calculation is suspect.

o If any two faces are oriented so that they would be visible to each
  other except for a piece of the surface that blocks the view then
  blocking_enclosure must be set true.

o If the surface is not the boundary of a bounded volume then the
  enclosure is partial and partial_enclosure must be set true.

o For partial enclosures the area of a virtual surface that would
  make the enclosure complete must be specified.  Chaparral will
  tell you what that area should be as part of the output.
