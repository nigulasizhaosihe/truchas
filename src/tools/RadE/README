GENERATING A RADIATION ENCLOSURE DATASET
----------------------------------------

Serial: genre <input_file> <encl_file>

Parallel: mpirun -np 128 genre <input_file> <encl_file>

The input file has the following format:

  &ENCLOSURE
    name =              ! user-supplied name for the enclosure
    mesh_file =         ! path to the Exodus/Genesis mesh file
    ignore_block_IDs =  ! list of element blocks to mask-off from the mesh
    side_set_ids =      ! list of side sets specifying the surface
    symmetries =        ! list of up to 3 symmetry operations:
                        ! Mirror<a>, a = X, Y, Z; e.g. MirrorZ
                        ! Rot<a><n>, a = X, Y, Z; n integer; e.g., RotZ3, RotX16
    displace_side_set_ids = ! list of side sets whose surfaces will be displaced
    displacement          = ! (x,y,z) displacement vector.
  /

  &CHAPARRAL
    blocking_enclosure  = .true.
    partial_enclosure   = .true.
    partial_area        = 50.0
    BSP_max_tree_depth  = 10
    BSP_min_leaf_length = 25
    spatial_tolerance   = 1.0e-8
    hemicube_resolution = 200
    min_separation      = 10.0
    max_subdivisions    = 20
    smoothing_tolerance = 1.0e-8
    smoothing_max_iter  = 100
  /

o The order of the namelists does not matter, and there may be other stuff
  in the input file; behavior is similar to Truchas input files.
o There must be a single ENCLOSURE namelist, and at most one CHAPARRAL
  namelist.  If there is a CHAPARRAL namelist the specified enclosure
  surface is generated and written to the enclosure file along with the
  calculated view factors, otherwise just the enclosure surface is written;
  this is useful for examining the surface for correctness prior to performing
  the expensive view factor calculation.
o Displacing surfaces is optional.  Any displaced surfaces must be totally
  disconnected from the remaining enclosure surfaces (this is checked).  The
  constant displacement must be compatibile with the specified symmetries
  (this is not checked).  This is useful when the mesh consists of disconnected
  parts that will be shifted relative to one another.  Instead of generating
  multiple 3D meshes, a single 3D mesh plus use of this displacement option
  is all that is needed.


COMPARING TWO RADIATION ENCLOSURE DATASETS
------------------------------------------

If you've generated multiple datasets for the same enclosure using different
sets of Chaparral parameters, it is useful to compare the calculated view
factor matrices.  You can do this with cmpre:

Serial: cmpre <encl_file1> <encl_file2>

Parallel: mpirun -np 128 cmpre <encl_file1> <encl_file2>
(only useful if the matrix is too large to be held on a single process.)

The program simply prints out several VF operator norms of the difference
of the two view factor matrices to the screen.  It also prints the largest
single difference in matrix and its row and column location.  Naturally
both files must contain VF data, and the enclosure surfaces must be the
same.

  
VISUALIZING AN ENCLOSURE DATASET
--------------------------------

Serial: vizre [options] enclosure_file gmv_file

Parallel: mpirun -np 128 vizre [options] enclosure_file gmv_file
(only useful if the matrix is too large to be held on a single process.)

Writes a GMV-format visualization file for the specified enclosure.
If the enclosure includes view factor data, the ambient view factor
and view factor matrix row sums are written as face variables.
 
Options:
  -r list      Write the specified rows or columns of the view factor matrix
  -c list      as face variables.  List is a comma-separated list of ranges;
               a range is index, first:last, or first:last:stride.
  -s           Write the fully-developed enclosure surface defined by the
               enclosure's symmetries.  The default is to write just the
               generating surface.
  -h, --help   Display this help and exit.

* Only surface faces are written.
* Faces are oriented and GMV can optionally darken the "bottom" side
  (option "test normals")
* Surface side set info is written as GMV materials.
* When using the "-s" option, info about the copies of the generating
  surface are written as GMV flags.
* May need a parallel version simply because the VF matrix is too large
  to be held on a single process.
