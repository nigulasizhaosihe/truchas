!!  HIJACKING TRUCHAS
!!
!!  To hijack Truchas, find the line "!#define HIJACK" in drivers.F90 and
!!  uncomment it.  Recompile.  Now this subroutine will be called *instead* of
!!  CYCLE_DRIVER.  All the usual initialization will have been done and all
!!  of that data is available to this subroutine to use.  When this subroutine
!!  returns, truchas is shutdown as usual.
!!
!!  NB: Do not commit your customized version of this file over the stub file,
!!  nor the modified version of drivers.F90.
