!! TRUCHAS_TIMERS
!!
!! This module provides the subroutines START_TIMER and STOP_TIMER for timing
!! nested sections of code.  Use of the timers requires no more than calling
!! START_TIMER and STOP_TIMER in matching pairs with an arbitrary string
!! argument to name the timer.  The only requirement is that the timers be
!! nested; the timer most recently started (and still running) is the only one
!! eligible to be stopped.
!!
!! The timers come from Petaca's TIMER_TREE_TYPE module.
!!
!! The subroutine WRITE_TIMER_DATA (no arguments) writes the accumulated timer
!! data to the same destinations as TLS_info.  Note that this procedure only
!! writes data from one process under the assumption that each process generates
!! an identical timer tree with essentially the same times (wall clock).  This
!! will be the case if the timers are always started and stopped collectively.
