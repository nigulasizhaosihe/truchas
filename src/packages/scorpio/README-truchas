This is a slightly modified version of the original Scorpio library for use
by Truchas. The changes relative to the upstream version are maintained on
the truchas branch of the repository https://gitlab.com/truchas/scorpio

A brief summary of the changes
------------------------------
* Makefiles replaced by a CMake build system that works within the Truchas
  build system (but not standalone).

* A new function scorpio_create_link was added to support HDF5 soft links.

* A couple parallel bugs in scorpio_write.c were fixed.

* The byte output type was changed to H5T_NATIVE_OPAQUE from H5T_NATIVE_INT8.

* Updates for HDF5 1.10 compatibility.
