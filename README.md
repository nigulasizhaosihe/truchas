Truchas
==============================================================================
Truchas is open source software developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) and collaborators for physics-based modeling and simulation of
manufacturing processes. Its core capabilities are primarily geared toward metal
casting, with capabilities for metal additive manufacturing under active
development. It is, however, a general multi-physics computational tool that is
useful for a wider range of applications.

Truchas includes coupled physics models for incompressible multi-material flow
with interface tracking, heat transfer, phase change, view factor thermal
radiation, species advection-diffusion, elastic/plastic mechanics with contact,
and electromagnetics.  It uses conventional 3-D unstructured finite element
computational meshes composed of mixed element types, and employs finite volume,
finite element, and mimetic finite difference discretizations.

Truchas development is largely sponsored by the [Advanced Simulation and
Computing Program][1] (ASC) at LANL through its Telluride project to provide a
tool for simulating manufacturing processes in support of the Stockpile
Stewardship Program (SSP).
