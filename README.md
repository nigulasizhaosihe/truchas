Truchas
==============================================================================
Truchas is open source software developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) and collaborators for physics-based modeling and simulation of
manufacturing processes. Its core capabilities are primarily geared toward
metal casting, with developing capabilities for metal additive manufacturing.
It is, however, a general multi-physics computational tool that is useful for
a wider range of applications.

Truchas includes coupled physics models for incompressible multi-material flow
with interface tracking, heat transfer, phase change, view factor thermal
radiation, species advection-diffusion, elastic/plastic mechanics with contact,
and electromagnetics.  It uses conventional 3-D unstructured finite element
computational meshes composed of mixed element types, and employs finite volume,
finite element, and mimetic finite difference discretizations.
