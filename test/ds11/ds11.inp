DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 11

Spherically symmetric phase change problem in an annular wedge with internal
HTC interface condition between the outer mold shell and the inner metal.
Exercises the handling of gap cells in the mapping back and forth between
MATL and the material mesh function used by the diffusion solver.

An alternative that doesn't use gap elements.
Should give the same results
