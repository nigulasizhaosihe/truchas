DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 3

Coupled heat conduction and species diffusion.  This is a synthesis of
diffusion solver tests 1 and 2.  By construction the heat equation and
species concentration diffusion equation are the same and have the same
solution.  The nonlinear coupling conspires to produce the same conduction
and diffusion coefficents as in tests 1 and 2 as long as the soution fields
remain identical as they should.
