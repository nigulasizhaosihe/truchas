DYNAMIC FREE-SURFACE FLUID/VOID FLOW PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------------
### free-surf-flow-1
Inviscid fluid flowing into a void-filled pipe (1D in 2D domain)

### free-surf-flow-2
Inviscid fluid draining from a pipe and being replaced by void (1D in 2D domain)

### free-surf-flow-3
Plug of inviscid fluid traveling down a void-filled pipe (1D in 2D domain)

### free-surf-flow-4
Fluid/void broken dam-like problem in a 2D box (no in/outflow)

### Other test problems not driven by ctest

* prob2: oscillating fluid in a 1D U-tube with gravity
* prob6: plug of fluid traveling down a void-filled pipe that constricts
