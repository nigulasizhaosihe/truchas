DYNAMIC FREE-SURFACE FLUID/VOID FLOW PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------------
### free-surf-flow-1
Inviscid fluid flowing into a void-filled pipe (1D in 2D domain)

### free-surf-flow-2
Inviscid fluid draining from a pipe and being replaced by void (1D in 2D domain)

### free-surf-flow-3
Plug of inviscid fluid traveling down a void-filled pipe (1D in 2D domain)

### free-surf-flow-4
Fluid/void broken dam-like problem in a 2D box (no in/outflow)

### free-surf-flow-5
This is a variation of free-surf-flow-3 with a 3D domain and 3x3 cells
in the cross-section, and uses a regular mesh with node positions
perturbed by 10% of the local edge length.

### Other test problems not driven by ctest

* prob2: oscillating fluid in a 1D U-tube with gravity
* prob6: plug of fluid traveling down a void-filled pipe that constricts
