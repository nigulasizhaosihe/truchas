Inviscid Flow in 2D Diverging Duct
----------------------------------

This is the original diverging duct problem. Domain is a 2D diverging channel
of length 10, width 1 at the left inlet side (x=0), width 1.25 at the right
outlet side (x=10). Inflow velocity is 1 and outlet pressure is 0.68. Free-slip
BC on the remaining sides. The domain is crudely discretized by a 1D line of
cells. The expected velocity (directed along the axis of the channel) is given
by the divergence free condition

    V = 1/(1 + 0.025*x)

and expected pressure is given by Bernoulli's principle

    P/rho + V**2/2 = const ==> P = 1 - 0.5 / (1 + 0.025*x)**2
