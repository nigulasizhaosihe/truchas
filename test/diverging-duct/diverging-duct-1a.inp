INVISCID FLOW IN 2D DIVERGING DUCT
----------------------------------
Radial inviscid flow across a narrow sector of an annulus with inner radius 1
and outer radius 2. Unit radial velocity at inlet (r=1) and pressure 2 at the
outlet (r=2). Free slip BC along the walls. rho = 4. The analytic solution is

  (u,v) = (\cos\theta,\sin\theta)*(1/r),  p = 5/2 - 2/r^2

NB: We would prefer to initialize the velocity with the exact solution, but
due to current limitations this isn't possible and instead initialize with
a constant velocity direct along the axis of the flow channel. Thus we have
an initial transient we aren't really interested in computing. In addition,
we are using ortho operators here, though this ought to be very good for the
mesh used.
