FLUID-SOLID 2D HYDROSTATIC TEST
-------------------------------
Inviscid fluid at rest in a [-5,5]^2 solid-containing domain subject to
gravity; solid/fluid are side-by-side. Fluid should remain at rest, with
a linear pressure field.

With g=(1,0,0): rho = 2, p = c + x, in x > 0

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated g)
