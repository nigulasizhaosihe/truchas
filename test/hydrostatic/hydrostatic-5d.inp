TWO-FLUID 2D HYDROSTATIC TEST WITH MIXED CELLS
----------------------------------------------

Two inviscid fluids at rest in a [-5,5]^2 domain subject to gravity; lighter
fluid on top. Fluid should remain at rest, with a linear pressure field.

With g=(0,-1,0): rho2 = 2, p = -2*y + c, in y < 1/2;
                 rho1 = 1, p = -y - 0.5 + c, in y > 1/2.

Fluid interface placed at cell midpoint.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated g)
