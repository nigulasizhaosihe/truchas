FLUID/VOID 2D HYDROSTATIC TEST
------------------------------
Inviscid fluid at rest in lower half of a [-5,5]^2 domain with void above,
subject to gravity. Fluid should remain at rest, with a linear pressure field.

With g=(0,-1,0): rho = 2, p = -2*y, in y < 0; p = 0 in y > 0

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated g)
