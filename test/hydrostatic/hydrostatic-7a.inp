TWO-FLUID 3D HYDROSTATIC TEST WITH MIXED CELLS
----------------------------------------------
Two inviscid fluids at rest in a 5^3 domain subject to gravity. The domain is
centered on the orgin and rotated 45 degrees about the z axis and then 54.75
degrees about the x axis to align one of the cube diagonals with the z axis.
Gravity force is directed in the negative z direction, with lighter fluid
in the upper part of the domain. Fluid should remain at rest, with a linear
pressure field.

    rho2 = 2, p = -2*(z-sqrt(3)) + c, in z < sqrt(3);
    rho1 = 1, p = -(z-sqrt(3)) + c, in z > sqrt(3).
