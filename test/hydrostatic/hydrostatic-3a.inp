TWO-FLUID 2D HYDROSTATIC TEST
-----------------------------

Two inviscid fluids at rest in a [-5,5]^2 domain subject to gravity; lighter
fluid on top. Fluid should remain at rest, with a linear pressure field.

With g=(0,-1,0): rho2 = 2, p = c1 - 2*y, in y < 0;
                 rho1 = 1, p = c2 - y, in y > 0.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated g)
