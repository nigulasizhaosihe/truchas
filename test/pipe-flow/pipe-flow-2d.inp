2D PIPE FLOW WITH SOLID WALLS
-----------------------------
Simple viscous flow through a 2D pipe of length L. Constant pressure p1 at one
end, p2 at the other. No-slip along the walls of the pipe. Extend uniformly
in the z direction (3 cells thick) with free-slip BC on the z=const boundaries.
Solution is symmetric across the mid-plane of the pipe, so solve in one half
only with free-slip BC on the symmetry plane. Domain includes solid material
which forms the wall of the pipe (all cells are single material), and which
should not participate in the simulation.

At steady state the axial velocity U is a function of the coordinate across the
width of the pipe, with U'' = (p2-p1)/(2*mu*L).

If width of the pipe is 2, -1 <= y <= 1, p1 = 3, p2 = 0, mu = 3, L = 1, then
U(y) = (1 - y^2)/2, and maximum axial velocity along axis is 1/2.
