2D PIPE FLOW WITH SOLID WALLS
-----------------------------
Simple viscous flow through a 2D pipe of length L. Constant pressure p1 at one
end, p2 at the other. Extend uniformly in the z direction (3 cells thick) with
free-slip BC on the z=const boundaries. Solution is symmetric across the mid-
plane of the pipe, so solve in one half only with free-slip BC on the symmetry
plane. Domain includes solid material which forms the wall of the pipe (all
cells are single material), and which should not participate in the simulation.
We rely on the default free-slip BC and do not explicitly specify them.

The intended BC at the wall (a surface interior to the mesh) is no slip. For
this test we explicitly set a no-slip BC on the wall surface, which is interior
to the mesh.

At steady state the axial velocity U is a function of the coordinate across the
width of the pipe, with U'' = (p2-p1)/(2*mu*L).

If width of the pipe is 2, -1 <= y <= 1, p1 = 3, p2 = 0, mu = 3, L = 1, then
U(y) = (1 - y^2)/2, and maximum axial velocity along axis is 1/2.
