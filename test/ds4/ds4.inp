DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 4

Phase change.  2D problem, 1 cell thick.  Rectangular 'mold' domain with
'metal' inclusion in the middle of the domain created using a cylindrical
body, giving rise to mixed material cells.  Imposed flux at left end of
domain, Dirichlet condition at the other end, and no flux on the remaining
boundaries, melts the initially solid metal.

This is a variation of Diffusion Solver Test 2.

Input file is written to allow running the same problem using the existing
HT/PC solver.  Just enable heat_conduction and phase_change, and disable
diffusion_solver in the PHYSICS namelist.  Note that the mesh is non-orthogonal
(a jittered orthogonal mesh) and that LSLR discrete operator seems to have
problems with it and/or the boundary conditions so ortho operators are used
for HT/PC.
