DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 7

Linear heat conduction with simple radiation boundary condition.  Spherically
symmetric problem solved in a 1-cell thick annular wedge.  No heat flux at the
inner surface, simple heat radiation at the outer surface, and no flux on the
remaining symmetry planes.

This is essentially the same problem as the species diffusion TEST 1, only
expressed in terms of temperature rather than concentration; the solutions
should be identical, and the enthalpy 1/4 of the temperature.

Input file is written to allow running the same problem using the existing
HT/PC solver.  Just turn on heat conduction and turn off the diffusion solver
in the PHYSICS namelist.  Note that the mesh is non-orthogonal and that LSLR
discrete operator seems to have problems with it and/or the boundary conditions
so ortho operators are used for HT/PC.
