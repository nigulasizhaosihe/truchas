HTVOID3 -- Solidifying flow with void

This test exercises phase change within the free surface flow-coupled
heat tranfer solver.  The focus here is on the coupling of phase change
to flow.  The domain is a 1D flow channel thermally coupled to a colder,
high heat capacity wall body (1 cell thick) on the bottom of the channel.
The simulation begins with the channel filled with a hot fluid flowing to
the right.  Void enters at the left end and the fluid exits the right end
with a fixed unit velocity.  A right-directed gravity is included to help
maintain a flat fluid/void interface.  The interface between the fluid and
lower wall body is modeled with an internal HTC condition.  The fluid cools
and solidifies along the wall as the flow develops, and the simulation ends
before all the fluid has exited the domain.

NOTE: The flow itself is very sensitive to the various flow parameters.
Small changes to things -- initial step size, for example -- will lead to
different flow solutions with bits of fluid left behind or not.  The flow
solution is largely correct, but the differences in which cells are void
will result in heat solutions that are not comparable.
