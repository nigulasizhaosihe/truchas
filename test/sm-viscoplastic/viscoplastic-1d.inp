# 1D Viscoplasticity verification
#
# This problem sets up a uniform stress field, and a viscoplastic model which
# changes the plastic strain negligibly over time, for a predictable constant
# plastic strain rate over time.
#
# The strain is a uniform 1e-3 in the xx component and 0 in other components.
#
# The stress is therefore [4e6, 2e6, 2e6, 0, 0, 0] everywhere.
#
# The Von Mises Stress is then 2e6.
#
# At this stress, the viscoplastic model produces a strain rate of 1.41e-9,
# negligible on the order of the 1e-3 strain field, and thus linearly increases
# the plastic strain over the curse of the simulation.
