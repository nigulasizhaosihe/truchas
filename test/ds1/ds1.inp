DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 1

Nonlinear diffusion of species C.  2D problem, 1 cell thick.
Imposed flux at left end of rectangular domain, Dirichlet condition at
the other end, and no flux on the remaining boundaries.  Low-diffusivity
inclusion in the middle of the domain created using a 'cylindrical' body,
giving rise to mixed material cells.

See diffusion solver tests 2, 3 and 4 for variations.
