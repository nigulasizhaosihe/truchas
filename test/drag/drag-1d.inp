1D PRESSURE-DRIVEN FLOW WITH MUSHY-ZONE POROUS MEDIA DRAG
---------------------------------------------------------

X-directed flow in a 20 x 1 x 1 channel with high pressure at the left end and
low pressure at the right end. Free slip BC on sides of the channel. There are
multiple zones across the channel in the y-direction but only a single zone in
the z-direction, allowing all cells to be initialized with a 50-50 fluid-solid
fraction. The fluid starts at rest and maintains a spatially uniform x-directed
velocity. The x-component u is given by

  u(t) = (-p_x/(\mu D(f_l))) (1 - \exp(-\mu D(f_l) t/\rho)),

  D(f_l) = D_0 (1 - f_l)^2 / f_l^3,

where $\mu$ is the viscosity, $f_l$ the liquid volume fraction, $D_0$ the drag
coefficient, $p_x$ the pressure gradient, and $\rho$ the fluid density. For the
current setup

  u(t) = 1.5 (1 - \exp(-2t)).

At steady state

  u = - (1/D(f_l)) p_x / \mu,

which corresponds to Darcy flow with permeability $K = 1/D$ given by the
Carman-Kozeny relation.

This problem uses a fixed time step of 2**-6 and the 2nd order trapezoid rule
for integrating the drag term (drag_implicitness = 0.5).

This input file can also be used (and has been) to establish 1st order
convergence when using fully implicit discretization (drag_implicitness = 1)
and 2nd order convergence when using the trapezoid rule.
