1D AXISYMMETRIC INDUCTION HEATING WITH TIME-DEPENDENT EM SOURCE

Cylindrical conductor in a uniform, alternating magnetic field.  Domain is
one quarter of a thin cross-sectional slab, surrounded by some free-space.
The EM conductivity is larger in a surface layer of the cylinder than in
its core.  The source charcteristics (magnitude, frequency) change several
times during the course of the simulation.  The hex mesh includes the free
space region.  The tet mesh conforms to the hex mesh, being obtained by
subdivision of the hex cells.
