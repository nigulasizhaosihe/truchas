SINGLE FLUID 2D ADVECTION
-------------------------
An utterly trivial problem of advection in a single fluid domain using a
constant uniform velocity. Domain is 31x31x3 with unit cells. Velocity
is directed diagonally across the mesh.

There's not much we can check here other than the run completes without
error, the velocity on cells is what was specified, and that the material
fraction is 1.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated velocity)
