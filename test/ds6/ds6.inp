DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 6

Coupled heat conduction and 2-component species diffusion with Soret terms.
Spherically symmetric problem solved in a 1-cell thick annular wedge.
No heat flux on the inner surface and symmetry sides, Dirichlet conditions
on the outer surface.  No species flux on all boundaries.

The problem has an analytic steady-state (t=infinity) solution with
conductivity K=T, diffusivities D=T^2, soret coefficient D*S1=T*(3*phi1+phi2)
and S2=-S1.  At long times we should have

  T^2 = 4 + (Q/162)*(29 - 27*r**2 - 2/r)
  
and if phi = (3*phi1 + phi2)/2, then

  T^2 * phi = constant (undetermined)
  
Note that the total integrals of phi1, phi2 and hence phi are conserved
and so the constant can be determined in principle.
 
This problem is a variation of a similar problem with a single species
phi (= (3*phi1 + phi2)/2) with diffusivity D=T^2 and Soret coefficient
D*S=2*T*phi.  (All we've done here is to split phi into two pieces.)
