FLUID/VOID 3D HYDROSTATIC TEST WITH MIXED CELLS
-----------------------------------------------
Inviscid fluid at rest in a 5^3 domain with void above, subject to gravity.
The domain is centered on the orgin and rotated 45 degrees about the z axis
and then 54.75 degrees about the x axis to align one of the cube diagonals
with the z axis. Gravity force is directed in the negative z direction.
Fluid should remain at rest, with a linear pressure field.

    rho = 2, p = -2*(z-sqrt(3)), in z < sqrt(3); p = 0 in z > sqrt(3)
