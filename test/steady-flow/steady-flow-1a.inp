STEADY INVISCID 2-MATERIAL FLOW
-------------------------------
2D square domain (1 cell thick in z) with steady uniform flow directed along
the x-axis. Prescribed inflow velocity on the left and dirichlet pressure on
the right. Two equal-density fluids with planar interface orthogonal to the
x-axis. Constant initial velocity field consistent with the BC. Velocity
should remain constant and the fluid interface should be advected exactly
across the domain.

This problem is analogous to a pure advection problem, except that instead
of a prescribed constant velocity, we solve for the velocity, expecting to
recovery that constant velocity.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated velocity)
