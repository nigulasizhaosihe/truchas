STEADY INVISCID 2-MATERIAL FLOW
-------------------------------
2D rectangular domain (1 cell thick in z) with steady uniform flow directed
along the x-axis. Prescribed inflow velocity on the left and dirichlet pressure
on the right. Two fluids with planar interface oblique to the x-axis. Fluid
density ratio of 1000 with denser fluid trailing. Constant initial velocity
field consistent with the BC. Velocity should remain constant. Interface will
not be exactly advected due to approximation errors from Young's method for
computing the interface normal adjacent to the boundary.

This problem is analogous to a pure advection problem, except that instead
of a prescribed constant velocity, we solve for the velocity, expecting to
recovery that constant velocity.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated velocity)
