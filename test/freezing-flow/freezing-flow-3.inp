SOLIDIFYING FLOW
----------------
2D, 1 x 0.5 domain with uniform 0.1 resolution hex mesh.

1D heat conduction/phase change problem, top to bottom. Uniform hot initial
temperature (above liquidus), with a cold top boundary temperature (below
solidus), and adiabatic BC everywhere else.  Liquid/solid interface propogates
down from the top, cell-by-cell. Not until the very end is more than one cell
in the mushy zone.

1D steady inviscid flow from left to right. Unit inflow velocity on the left
and 0 pressure BC on the right. Free slip everywhere else.

Handling of inflow enthalpy advection should conspire to give the solution
on an infinitely long (in x) domain.

This is intended to test how the momentum of solidified fluid is handled in
the flow solver.
