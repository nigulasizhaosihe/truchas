PASSIVE ADVECTION-DIFFUSION OF MULTIPLE SCALARS

Passive advection-diffusion of two (independent) scalars in a 1D channel
with steady, uniform, left-to-right flow. The initial profiles of the scalars
are smooth step functions compatible with the constant inflow values. The
initial profiles propagate to the right under the flow and diffuse. The
primary aim of this problem is to exercise advection with multiple scalars.
