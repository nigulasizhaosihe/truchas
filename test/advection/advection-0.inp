SINGLE FLUID 2D ADVECTION
-------------------------
An utterly trivial problem of advection in a single fluid domain using a
constant uniform velocity. Domain is 31x31x3 with unit cells. Velocity
is directed diagonally across the mesh.

There's not much we can check here other than the run completes without
error.
