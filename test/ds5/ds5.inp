DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 5

3-component, coupled nonlinear diffusion.  Spherically symmetric problem
solved in a 1-cell thick annular wedge.  Dirichlet conditions at the inner
surface, flux conditions at the outer surface, and no flux on the remaining
boundaries.

The first component is decoupled from the others and serves as the reference
field.  The analytic steady-state solution is u1(r) = sqrt[(4/9)*r^-1 - (1/3)]
for r in [1/3,1], with a diffusivity D1 = 2*u1.

The remaining two fields, u2 and u3, share a common coupled diffusivity
D2 = D3 = 4*u2 - 2*u3.  The initial conditions and boundary values conspire
so that for all time we have u1 = 2*u2 - u3, and moreover that u3 = 2*u1
and u2 = (3/2)*u1.

The Dirichlet values for u1, u2 and u3 are 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively.
The flux values for u1, u2 and u3 are 4/9, 2/3 and 8/9 respectively.
